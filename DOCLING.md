?
- VLM pipelines not saving all images, ex. keeps text only from the pie chart
    - but this is not a VLM decision - where library decides this? pdf parsing?
        - does it add to my prompt?
- PictureDescriptionApiOptions
- pipeline_options.generate_page_images doesn't work with any pipeline

Notes
- nonVLM vs localVLM better at tables edge cases
- nonVLM truncates/failsFull annotations, no warnings
